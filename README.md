# Methane Anomaly Detector 
### Fall 2021 Sarukkai Social Impact Award Winner

Methane Anomaly Detector (MAD) identifies potential methane emission anomalies in California by applying deep learning techniques on data collected by the Sentinel 5P satellite launched by the European Space Agency. Our web application showcases near real-time data that is easily accessible, offers personalized location search to view anomalies in specific areas, and enables insight-driven decisions from interactive visualizations. MAD enables local regulators and methane-emitting facility owners to identify abnormal methane levels in their region and kick off more in-depth investigations into possible root causes. Ultimately, our product works to aid methane emission reduction in alignment with President Joe Biden's pledge to slash global methane emissions by 30% by 2030.
